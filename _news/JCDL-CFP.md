SIG-CM is hosting a workshop at the 2019 [Joint Conference on Digital Libraries](https://2019.jcdl.org/). The workshop will take place on **June 6th** at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana. 

Consider the call for papers below for directions on submitting to the workshop. All accepted submissions will be given a 15-25 minute slot for presentation and discussion. Registration information can be found [here](https://2019.jcdl.org/registration/).

### Call For Papers

**Workshop Description**        
Digital libraries, archives, museums and repositories often rely upon conceptual models that provide formal representation information and identity conditions for informational resources. Examples include conceptual models traditional to library and information sciences, such as Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), the uptake of data models from the semantic web, like the Resource Description Framework (RDF), as well as the development of protocols unique to the exchange of digital objects, such as the Open Archives Initiative for Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE).

Sustaining this rich tradition of research and development in conceptual modeling requires a collective effort from the digital library community. This workshop focuses on critically evaluating and furthering existing conceptual models, as well as developing an agenda for future research and community-building around these topics.

**Contributions**
We seek contributions from practitioners and researchers interested in digital collections in different domains, especially collections built upon different conceptual models emerging from different epistemologies and different traditions of knowledge organization: natural history museums, art museums, library special collections, archives, data repositories, earth science informatics, biodiversity informatics, etc. This may include topics relevant to conceptual modeling, including but not limited to:  - the history and evolution of conceptual models,
- extensions to, or critiques of, existing conceptual models,
- the development of domain-specific conceptual models (e.g. in the earth sciences, in the humanities, etc) applied strategies for modeling in development processes,
- critical examination of the social and technical implications of conceptual models.

Contributions may be of two varieties:

- **Full research papers** should present results from completed research, or fully developed conceptual analysis. Full research papers should be a maximum of 3000 words in length (not including citations).
- **Short research papers** can present in-progress work, small case studies, position statements, or theoretical and conceptual analysis that is at an early stage of development. Short research papers should be a maximum 1500 words in length (not including citations).

**Dates**         
- Submission Deadline is April 25th
- Notifications will be sent no later than April 29th
- Accepted submissions can be revised before May 25th. At the time we will post all accepted submissions to the workshop website.
- Workshop will take place June 6th.

**Instructions for Submission**       
Please submit a PDF, DOC, or TXT document to nmweber@uw.edu by April 25th. You may use any format or citation style that you prefer - However, we do suggest following the conference's [ACM template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).  

All Submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee.

We're also excited to announce that [Dr. Karen Wickett](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/karen-wickett) will be giving a keynote lecture at the workshop! We plan to organize a special issue for an information science journal based on the proceedings. If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact with any of the organizers in advance.
