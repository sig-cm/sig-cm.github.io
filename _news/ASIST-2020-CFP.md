### TL;DR
An ASIS&T 2020 workshop for practitioners and researchers studying conceptual models in sociotechnical systems. Contributions to the workshop can be works-in-progress or completed research papers - due Sept 25th (see submission directions below). Keynote speakers will include Dr. Amelia Acker (University of Texas) and Dr. Ryan Shaw (University of North Carolina). 

## About
Information Science has long worked at the intersection of technology development and the critical study of technologies in particular places, serving particular people, at particular points in time. Conceptual models -- the representation of how a system works, as well as the information objects they process and transmit -- are fundamental to the construction, maintenance, and use of digital infrastructures that mutually constitute people and technology (the sociotechnical) (Kling, 1980; Agre, 1994; Selbst et al, 2019). Although conceptual models are critical to sociotechnical systems, they are often overlooked or under-described in information science research (Weber et al, 2019). 

We argue that current social, political, and economic conditions require a renewed attention to how conceptual models have been implemented in sociotechnical systems. There are numerous examples of sociotechnical systems that are fundamentally shaped by the conceptual models that they enact: for instance, the governance of data access through APIs (Asad et al, 2018); the affordances and limitations to standardization in online social networks (Brubaker et al, 2016); the use of encoding schemes like UTF that impact -- and sometimes, limit -- the representation of knowledge systems (Lampland and Star, 2009), etc. Each of these interventions shape and are shaped by conceptual models of information and its appropriate use. Further, the affordances and limitations of a conceptual model impact the ways in which a user can become informed, can operate with autonomy, and can produce new knowledge (Sovacool & Hess, 2017) 

Without a critical interrogation of conceptual models in practice we risk overlooking the negative impacts they may have - such as alienating, disenfranchising, or significantly restricting the liberties that a sociotechnical approach seeks to engender (Fuenfschilling & Binz, 2018). 

This workshop is meant to convene researchers in information science interested in critical, careful examination of how we model information in sociotechnical systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to how we perceive of users, construct use cases, and develop technologies that facilitate accurate discovery, retrieval, and interaction with information objects. By interrogating the conceptual models underpinning sociotechnical systems we believe there is a unique and important contribution to be made by information scientists in combating misinformation, reducing bias, promoting fairness, and producing the types of information systems that allow communities of practice to flourish. 

### Call for Contributions

Contributions may be of two varieties:

- **Full research papers** should present results from completed research, or mature conceptual analysis. Full research papers should be a maximum of 3000 words in length (not including citations).
- **Short research papers** can present in-progress work, small case studies, position statements, or theoretical and conceptual analysis that is at an early stage of development. Short research papers should be a maximum 1500 words in length (not including citations)

Research papers might address (but are not limited to) the following topics: 
- Critique of conceptual models in practice (e.g. in databases, digital libraries, retrieval systems, and in many other information systems).
- Design and construction of conceptual models in any domain, particularly with regard to sociotechnical implications.
- Consideration of models for curation, preservation, and sustainability of information objects embedded in sociotechnical systems. 
- The impact of conceptual models on public knowledge, research, and scholarship.
- Methods for and applications of the critical study of conceptual models in sociotechnical systems: deconstructing an API; conducting algorithmic or other technology audits; close readings of standards and their implementation; critical histories of standards; evaluations of use, implementation, and impact; etc.   

**Dates**          
- Submission Deadline is September 25th 
- Notifications will be sent to authors no later than September 29th
- Accepted submissions can be revised before October 15th. At the time we will post all accepted submissions to a workshop website.

**Instructions for Submission**            
Please submit a PDF, DOC, Markdown, or TXT document to `nmweber@uw.edu` by September 25th. You may use any format or citation style that you prefer. 

All Submissions will be reviewed by the organizing committee, and feedback (regardless of acceptance) will be provided to authors. If you have any questions please feel to contact an organizer in advance of the deadline for submissions. 

Submissions will be non-archival, and the workshop is designed to support authors in developing and iterating their papers toward journal publication.

## Workshop Format (tentative)
The proposed workshop will follow a mini-conference format, with an agenda focused on presenting and workshopping research papers. The workshop will take place across two days - October 22nd and 23rd (1-5pm EST) and include keynote talks from two experts in the field: Dr. Amelia Acker, and Dr. Ryan Shaw. The workshop will culminate in a forward-looking collaborative discussion about a conceptual modeling research agenda for information science.
